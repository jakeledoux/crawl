# Dummy Crawler

> :warning: This game is currently in the pre-alpha stage!

The world's laziest text-based dungeon crawler "RPG". You choose which of two
caves to enter, and you either live or die. Level up, collect loot, and kill
baddies. Rinse and repeat.


This game's so lazy that I didn't even write most of the content, and instead
pre-generated it with OpenAI's GPT-3 and Codex models.
